# SpinCord
A "spin inspired" Powercord theme for Discord. Almost everything spins when hovered over. May induce vomiting.

## Installation 
Navigate to the Powercord `themes` folder. This is usually found in `powercord\src\Powercord\themes` on Windows. You can also use this command: 
```
cd powercord/src/Powercord/themes
```
Open a terminal (command prompt) in the current directory if one is not already open and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/GCPins/SpinCord
```
